# MCP Application

This is a simple MCP application built using Quarkus. It includes:

1. A REST client tool that calls a POST service returning GeoJson.
2. A REST service that processes natural language prompts to find charging stations on a map.
3. Integration with an MCP Tool Service to translate prompts into coordinates and call the REST client.

## Components

- **MCP Server**: Handles REST service requests and processes prompts.
- **MCP Client**: REST client tool that interacts with external services.
- **MCP Tools**: Services for translating prompts and handling GeoJson data.

## Setup

Instructions on setting up and running the application will be added here.
